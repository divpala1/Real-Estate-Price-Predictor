# Real-Estate-Price-Predictor
A Machine Learning Project architected in Python. A database of a housing company is taken for this project and fed to the model. And using different models prices are predicted.  

The code is well commented for better understanding.

To explore different methods to deal with missing data, 5 entries from column RM are deleted.  

A pipeline is created for using the model.  

Three different types of models were used and their RMSE scores were calculated.  
Models used:-  
-> Linear Regressor  
-> Decision Tree Regressor  
-> Random Forest Regressor  
  
The main project file is named 'Real Estate ML Project.ipynb'. Then the model is exported to a .joblib type file.  
The 'Model usage.ipynb' is a guide on how to use the model in python script.

Thank you
